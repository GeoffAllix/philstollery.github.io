I've  been working with Microsoft Technologies since [1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk "Woo Hoo"), including Visual Basic, C++, .NET, Access, SharePoint and SQL Server. My many years of industry experience is backed by a degree in Computer Science.

I have been involved in the design, implementation, and management of all types of data platform including OLTP, data warehousing, and OLAP. This includes multiple disciplines including database design, ETL, Power BI, and reporting and using multiple languages including Transact-SQL.

I am also an experienced developer of technical content. Recent projects include writing courses for the [SQL Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/sql-training.aspx "I contributed to some courses") and [SQL Server 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/course.aspx?cid=20768 "2017 revision") curricula.
