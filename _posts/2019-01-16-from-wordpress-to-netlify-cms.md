## Step 1
Build your static HTML website - you can use WordPress and the great wp2static plugin if you want.

## Step 2
Jekyllify your static HTML (see the [offical documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll))

## Step 3
Add Netlify CMS ([full guide](https://www.netlifycms.org/))

## Step 4
Git push - site is live!
